# Iris - Alfred Workflow

A workflow for Alfred 3.0 that allows you to quick search for a [movie](http://www.omdbapi.com/) or [subtitles](http://www.opensubtitles.org/).

The workflow script was built with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and, believe it or not, you need to install it on your machine in order to run it.

## How to use it

### Movies

The shortcut to search for a movie is: **⇧ + ⌘ + i**.
Alternatively you can use the keyword: **iris**.

### Subtitles

The shortcut to search for subtitles is: **⇧ + ⌘ + o**.

You can also search for subtitles by providing the file path. It will calculate the hash automatically and suggest subtitles for the same release.
